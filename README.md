# launch

## Description

Launch is a utility which leverages the [choose utility by chipsenkbeil](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/choose) to create a "poor-man's [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)". It supports the launching of applications via a gui, as well as via the command line.

The program creates a file ".launchdb" in the home directory, which is used as a cache of the data generated by the 'gen-launch-db' script. Whenever there is a failed search attempt, this script is run again in an attempt to locate the desired application.

## Usage

To launch an application, any of the below methods will work (note that for `launch` to work, the user must search for the desired application and select it):
```
launch chrome
launch "Google Chrome"
launch google chrome
launch
```

Note: The search tool in built into the choose utility is fuzzy in nature.

## Dependencies
* [choose-gui](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
* [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (The scripts can easily be modified to use find)

## Installation
Just place the `launch` and `gen-launch-db` scripts in your path and you can use the scripts as described above.
